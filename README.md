*JWT Authentication in Django:
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in Django, enabling secure user registration, login, and access control for protected views. 
The application utilizes Django's built-in authentication system along with Django REST Framework to manage user sessions and permissions effectively.
*Features
1. User Registration: New users can register using a user-friendly form.
2. User Login: Users can log in with their credentials, and upon successful authentication, they will be redirected to the home page.
3. User Logout: Users can log out, which clears their session.
4. They can test their token, create them and test using Insomnia.
5. Protected Views: Access to certain views is restricted to authenticated users only, ensuring that sensitive data is protected.
Technologies Used
Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
Django REST Framework: A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.
JWT: A compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
